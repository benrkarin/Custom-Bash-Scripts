# Bioinformatics Bash Script Collection
This GitHub repository contains a collection of various Bash scripts for bioinformatics. These scripts cover a range of topics. I included several scripts for setting up input files for BPP and processing BPP results. 

Feel free to use and modify these scripts according to your needs, and don't forget to cite the respective authors if required.
